Mike is a founder of Apotact Labs and currently lives in Austin, Texas.

Built upon a foundation and love of technology, his passion for
entrepreneurship is further motivated by his fascination with film and design.
While not busy running Apotact (which is rare), Mike is also a freelance
videographer who has completed work around the world, having received 
awards for his cinematography and editing in local film festivals.

Mike previously worked as a full-stack developer and iOS engineer, designing
and building apps from start to finish. He uses vim as much as possible.

He graduated from the University of Texas with a B.S. in Computer Science and
a B.S. in Radio-Television-Film.
