Mike is currently making email more enjoyable as a platform engineer at Nylas.

In the past he co-founded Gest and did everything from writing code, soldering
prototypes and designing interfaces to shooting videos, talking to customers and
pitching investors.

Before that he worked as a full-stack developer and iOS engineer, designing and
building mobile applications. Mike graduated from the University of Texas with a
B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Radio-Television-Film.

On the weekends you'll find him surfing in Pacifica and biking in Marin.
